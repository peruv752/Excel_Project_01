Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 so that they can understand their customers and grow their business in 2023
So here i have taken 6 topics for which I have first cleaned the data,then I have Processed the data by sorting and filtering it out.Then
i have creted pivot tables from which then i drew pivot charts.Finally i collected all these charts onto one sale report adding along the 
sliders.
